Questions/notes:

1.X: 8310 + 35(additional) = 8345 SNPs, yearly data only for US;

2.confounding factors(entire columns missing for several countries);
missing entries in column; air pollution missing for certain years;

3.scatterplot(log transform GDP)

python -m pip install openpyxl

1. remove puerto rico(missing all Y)
2. Use first X for Y, check significance
  then scatterplot for all Zs
3. auto correlation(ar(1))
4. fruit + veggies
repeated measure: multiple reg
fitting

imputation(missing values)

scatter matrix WITH Y vs all education

observation values < 0.5, remove

1. Y vs. Zs

check diagonal

2. ed col 4,5,6,7,8 columns

4,6,7,8,10

delete 6,7(keep 8(total))
remove 4
keep 8
make upper triangle

remove air pollution 2.5, freedom of choice, negative affect
keep yearly temprature

consider combining meat consumption and happiness

#1/17
gdp-log

happiness, meat, temperature...  lm all + quadratic

air pollution categorical 

0-40/40-100, dummy variable with linear relations on both sides

edu:
only use 7 may need quadratic

fit overall repeated measures model


1/24
fix education with country other variables replace with other varibles 
with linear relations

all factors with gdp (yearwise) 
$impute not too many covariate

longitudinal

2/1
impute ggpairs and before impute ggpairs

impute by country/year
use gdp to impute other(not linear)
use average of short cycle ticiary to impute

use lm to impute for others
then fill in with mean

by country? 

quadratic

r package functional data analysis 
local constant: loess

gdp as x to predict factor 

2/8
mark where missing value is (where imputed values are)
regression line should be on observations

put fitted dots on plot

education (take average) then take loess 
repeated measures with covariance matrix structure with AR(1)
beta, beta conf interval, beta p-value

explain snp

2/14
out of range nearest neighbor(2) with left --uninterpolated data(k=3-4)
try linear or quadratic fit 
air pollution put one column loess

3,4,5,6,7,11,12(exclude Y alco cosum)
try impute with gdp

ggplot and one by one imputation

2/21
snp, ci, p-value
contract research organization

2/28
all not significant 
check goodness of fit
add p_value_counfound(fdr -adjusted values)

3/7
correlation between var

3/21(me)
#1980 1990 1996 2006 2011 2012 2014 2018 are the Y years for alco consume
#90 95 00 05 10 16 alco prev
#80 96 06 11 12 14 smok consum 
#80 96 06 12 13 smok prev

documentation(r):method supplimentation
suppliment(add country/year, r code explaination)
ggplot (all counfound, no snp)

4/25
report on analysis
add residual documentation
add plots to folder
log transformation(add ggplot)
add every ggplot before log gdp
boxplot for each variable (alco consum)
